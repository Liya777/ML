# Support Vector Machine
Support vector machine is used to solve supervised machine learning problems, both classification, and regression. The classes can be separated by a line known as the 
line(2D)/hyperplane(3D). The criteria for positioning the hyperplane is that on the creation of a hyperplane, two margins are also created such that they lie on either 
side of hyperplane, linearly separating the two classes and also pass through the nearest point in the respective class. The dotted line in the figure represents the margin. 
The distance between the two margins is known as the marginal distance. Support vectors are the points that pass through the margins. The significance of the margins is that 
it classifies the points into two classes. The best classification results are obtained when we make the model more generalized. This can be obtained by maximizing the 
marginal distance. Hence we can say that hyperplane and margin are to be located in such a way that the marginal distance is maximum. This is in the case of linearly separable.
Consider a two-dimensional graph. In order to solve non linearly separable, the support vector machine uses a technique called SVM kernels. SVM kernels convert low dimension(2D) 
to high dimension(3D). The separation of the classes is clearly visible and a hyperplane is created between them. This is a brief explanation about the basics of the support 
vector machine.
